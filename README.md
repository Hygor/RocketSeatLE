# RocketSeat Learning Experience and Challenges


## About this repository

This is just a simple repository I made to keep track of my learning experience with RocketSeat's online course and challenges.


## How it works

To see where I am and what I'm doing, you just need to open the [Projects Menu](https://github.com/Hygor/RocketSeatLE/projects). There will be the boards and the content that I'm working on.
